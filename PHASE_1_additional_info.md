# Additional Information for PHASE 1 work proposal:

Potential datasets sources:
* Public Datasets:
    * Various public datasets provide drone imagery captured in different scenarios. Examples include the UAVid dataset, Stanford Drone Dataset, and ISPRS Benchmark Dataset.
    * Websites like Kaggle often host drone-related competitions that provide access to curated datasets.
* Open Aerial Imagery Platforms:
    * Platforms like OpenAerialMap and OpenStreetMap provide access to aerial imagery collected by drones and satellites. While these platforms may not offer consecutive frames, they can still be valuable sources for real drone imagery.

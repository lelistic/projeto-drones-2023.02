As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the idea of automatically creating scenarios for drone flight analysis through a domain-specific language that translates natural language to directives is certainly a fascinating concept. However, while there might not be a specific solution exactly as you've described it, there have been developments in the broader field of natural language processing (NLP) and automated scenario generation.

1. **Automated Scenario Generation:** There have been research efforts and tools aimed at automating scenario generation in various domains, including simulation environments. These tools often involve specifying high-level goals or constraints, and then algorithms generate relevant scenarios. While not necessarily directly tied to drone flights, they showcase the feasibility of using automation in scenario creation.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP has seen significant advancements, including the ability to translate natural language into specific actions or commands. While not widely explored in the context of drone flight simulation, the concept of creating a domain-specific language for automating scenario creation based on natural language instructions is theoretically plausible.

3. **Procedural Content Generation:** Procedural content generation techniques have been used in gaming and simulation contexts. These techniques involve algorithms that create content (such as scenarios or environments) based on predefined rules, allowing for dynamic and diverse scenario generation.

4. **Human-Machine Interaction:** Some simulation platforms and game engines have integrated voice commands or natural language interfaces to interact with the virtual environment. While not the same as a comprehensive domain-specific language, it shows a trend towards more intuitive interaction.

5. **Ongoing Research:** Since September 2021, there might have been advancements or projects that explore automated scenario generation for drone flight analysis using NLP or other techniques. Keeping an eye on academic publications, research conferences, and open-source projects could provide insights into any recent developments.

While there might not be an exact match to your envisioned solution, the convergence of NLP, procedural content generation, and simulation technologies suggests that your idea has the potential to be feasible and impactful. It's worth exploring further and considering how existing tools and technologies could be adapted to create a domain-specific language for scenario automation in drone flight analysis.
